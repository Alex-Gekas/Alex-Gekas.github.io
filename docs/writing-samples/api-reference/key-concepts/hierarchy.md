# How These Concepts Fit Together (Hierarchy)

Every forecast starts with a latitude/longitude. The NWS API resolves that point into:

- a grid cell (for detailed forecasts)
- one or more zones (for public forecasts and alerts)
- a forecast office (WFO) responsible for the region

This structure explains why the API returns links instead of direct data when you call `/points/{lat},{lon}`—it’s mapping your location to the correct grid, zones, and office.

**Figure:** Forecast data is organized hierarchically—a point belongs to a grid, which belongs to a zone, all managed by a forecast office (WFO).

# Why links instead of data?

The /points endpoint returns URLs because:

- Grid forecasts come from /gridpoints/{office}/{x},{y}
- Zone forecasts come from /zones/{type}/{zoneId}
- Each requires a separate, optimized query

Note: A single point can belong to multiple zones (county, fire weather, marine), but only one forecast grid. The API returns all applicable zones.
