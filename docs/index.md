# Technical writing for real-world products

Hi, I’m **Alex Gekas**, a technical writer focused on:

- API and developer documentation  
- Concept and reference guides  
- Tutorials and onboarding content  
- Style guides and documentation systems  

I use tools like **Material for MkDocs**, **Jekyll**, **GitHub Pages**, **OpenAPI**, and **Vale** to build documentation that feels production-ready and easy to maintain.

## What I do

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   ### API & Developer Docs
    I write reference documentation, endpoint overviews, and key concept guides that help developers get productive quickly, without assuming deep domain knowledge.

-   ### Concept & Reference Guides
    I explain systems, protocols, and data formats in clear, layered language—balancing high-level mental models with concrete, implementation-ready details.

-   ### Style Guides & Editing
    I create voice and tone guidelines, terminology frameworks, and Vale rules that keep documentation consistent across teams and over time.

-   ### Tutorials & Task Flows
    I design step-by-step tutorials that walk users through real tasks—integrating APIs, configuring tools, and troubleshooting common issues.

    - Separate concept topics (alerts, status codes, units)
    - Written for developers who aren’t weather experts

## How I approach documentation

I try to make each piece feel like it could live in a real product docs portal.

1. **Audience first**  
   I identify who’s actually reading (developer, educator, analyst, general user) and shape structure, examples, and terminology around their mental models.

2. **Clear information architecture**  
   I separate concepts, tasks, and references rather than mixing everything into a single long page. Users should be able to skim, not dig.

3. **Plain language, precise terms**  
   I follow the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide by default and adapt it where needed for VR, finance, or domain-specific content.

4. **Terminology and consistency**  
   I treat glossaries, term lists, and Vale linting rules as first-class tools to keep teams aligned over time.

5. **Iterative improvement**  
   I’m comfortable revising structure, rewriting for clarity, and tightening examples as feedback comes in.

## Blog

I use the blog to think out loud about documentation, tools, and process.

Possible topics you’ll see here:

- Structuring API references for non-experts  
- Using Material for MkDocs to build a docs hub  
- Designing stylfor exampleides for mixed technical/general audiences  
- Using Vale to enforce style and terminology  
- Before/after editing examples and what changed

## About me

I’m a technical writer with a background in languages and systems thinking. I enjoy:

- Explaining complex systems in approachable, accurate language  
- Helping developers and non-specialists work from the same documentation  
- Building documentation sites that feel like real, modern product docs

I work primarily with:

- **Static site generators:** Material for MkDocs, Jekyll  
- **Developer tooling:** Git, GitHub, OpenAPI/Swagger  
- **Quality & consistency:** Google Developer Style Guide, Vale  

If you’d like to talk about documentation, collaboration, or potential work:

## What you’ll find in this site

- **Writing samples:** API docs, concept guides, tutorials, and style guides  
- **Process & thinking:** Notes on how I approach structure, voice, and tooling  
- **Experiments:** New layouts, workflows, and documentation ideas

My goal is to make this site feel like a small, well-organized documentation portal that shows how I think, write, and structure information—not just a list of samples.
