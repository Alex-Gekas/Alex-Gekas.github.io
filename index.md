## About This Portfolio

Welcome! I am a technical writer with a passion for creating clear, accessible documentation that helps users succeed. This portfolio showcases writing samples and project work focused on API references, onboarding guides, and developer-focused content.

I will continue updating this site with new examples and contributions to open-source projects.
