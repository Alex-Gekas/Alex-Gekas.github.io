# GeoJSON Concepts

This concept document introduces the structure and purpose of **GeoJSON**, a widely used format for encoding geographic data structures using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). It provides essential background for developers working with location-based APIs, mapping libraries, or spatial data in web applications.

This page explains:

- What GeoJSON is and why it's useful
- Core data types (Feature, FeatureCollection, Geometry)
- Real-world use cases
- How GeoJSON integrates with the NWS API

Whether you're new to geographic data or need a refresher, this concept overview will help you understand how GeoJSON enables systems to describe points, lines, and polygons in a human-readable format.

# Understanding GeoJSON: A Developer’s Guide to Geospatial Data

**What's GeoJSON?**

GeoJSON is an open-standard, lightweight format for representing
geographic areas along with their non-spatial attributes, such as
temperature, wind speed, and place name. It's an extension of JSON
(JavaScript Object Notation) and is human-readable and easy to parse.
GeoJSON is widely supported in JavaScript and APIs. GeoJSON can be used
in mapping, geospatial APIs, and data visualization.

**The GeoJSON Data Model: How it Works**

GeoJSON is built from objects and arrays that define different geometric
shapes and their properties. The three primary types of objects are
FeatureCollection, Feature, and Geometry.

A FeatureCollection is a top-level object in GeoJSON and consists of:

- A "type" key set to "FeatureCollection".

- A "features" array containing multiple **Feature** objects.

In **GeoJSON**, a Feature is an object that represents **a single
geographic area** with both **spatial data** (geometry) and
**non-spatial data** (properties).

Each **Feature** has three key components:

1.  **"type": "Feature"**–Specifies that the object is a GeoJSON
    Feature.

2.  **"geometry"**–Defines the geographic shape. Geometry objects in
    GeoJSON include Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint,
    MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, and GeometryCollection.

3.  **"properties"**–Holds metadata or attributes about the feature
    (e.g., name, population, temperature).

Here’s an example of a GeoJSON Feature object within FeatureCollection:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;">{<br />
"type": "FeatureCollection",<br />
"features": [<br />
{<br />
"type": "Feature",<br />
"geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [-122.4194, 37.7749]
},<br />
"properties": { "name": "San Francisco" }<br />
}<br />
]<br />
}</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
</tbody>
</table>

**GeoJSON versus Generic JSON**

Unlike generic JSON, GeoJSON enforces a strict schema defined in **RFC
7946**. A structured format ensures that applications parsing GeoJSON
uniformly interpret the data structure. Every GeoJSON object must
include "type", "geometry", and "properties" fields and use one of the
predefined geometry types ("Point", "Polygon", etc.). To ensure
compliance with **RFC 7946**, you can validate GeoJSON using online
tools (for example, geojson.io), CLI utilities (e.g., geojsonhint), or
JavaScript libraries (for example, geojson-validation).

Enforcing a structured schema ensures:

- **Standardization** for interoperability across applications.

- **Efficient parsing** in web apps and APIs.

- **Seamless compatibility** with GIS tools and databases.

- **Prevention of common geospatial data errors.**

- **Scalability** for handling large geospatial datasets."

**Why GeoJSON Works the Way It Does**

GeoJSON is designed to be human-readable and machine-parseable, enabling
easy manipulation in JavaScript and other languages. It enforces a
standardized **Coordinate Reference System (CRS)**, defaulting to **WGS
84 (EPSG:4326)** to ensure global interoperability, with coordinates
always ordered as **\[longitude, latitude\]**. Unlike XML-based formats
like KML, GeoJSON is **self-contained and lightweight**, eliminating the
need for additional schemas. This makes GeoJSON faster to load and
easier to integrate with web applications, APIs, and databases.

**How GeoJSON Integrates into Developer Workflows**

GeoJSON is widely adopted across modern geospatial development stacks,
offering out-of-the-box compatibility with leading web mapping libraries
like Leaflet, Mapbox GL JS, and OpenLayers. This makes it easy to
render, style, and interact with spatial data in the browser.

On the server-side, many geospatial APIs—including OpenStreetMap and Google
Maps—accept GeoJSON as input or output, streamlining data exchange
between services. For storage and querying, PostgreSQL paired with the
PostGIS extension supports GeoJSON natively, enabling spatial queries
directly on GeoJSON fields.

Here’s a typical example of rendering GeoJSON data with Leaflet:
{% highlight javascript %}
L.geoJSON(myGeoJSON).addTo(map);
{% endhighlight %}


This level of integration makes GeoJSON a go-to format for developers
working on location-aware applications, from front-end visualization to
back-end processing.

**Strengths, Limitations, and Trade-offs**

GeoJSON offers several strengths that make it a solid choice for
developers working with geospatial data. It's lightweight and easy to
work with, particularly in web applications. Many geospatial tools and
databases—such as PostGIS, Leaflet, and Mapbox—provide native support
for GeoJSON, making integration straightforward.

However, GeoJSON isn't without limitations. It lacks built-in support
for topology, unlike formats such as TopoJSON. This can impact use cases
where preserving relationships between geometries is important.
Additionally, performance can degrade with large datasets; in such
cases, binary formats like FlatGeobuf may offer better efficiency in
terms of parsing speed and file size.

**GeoJSON Compared to Other Geospatial Formats**

When comparing GeoJSON to other common formats, its strengths and
trade-offs become clearer.

- **Shapefiles**, a legacy format from the GIS world, are more complex
  and typically require specialized software to manipulate. In contrast,
  GeoJSON is simpler, text-based, and more web-friendly, making it ideal
  for web development workflows.

- **KML**, an XML-based format used mainly with Google Earth, offers
  good support for rich styling and 3D features. However, GeoJSON
  integrates more seamlessly with modern web stacks and JavaScript-based
  mapping libraries.

- **TopoJSON** is a topology-preserving format that reduces file size by
  encoding shared boundaries only once. While this offers space savings,
  using TopoJSON requires preprocessing, making it slightly more
  involved than working with raw GeoJSON.

**Summary and Next Steps**

To sum up, GeoJSON is a structured JSON format designed specifically for
representing geospatial data. It works exceptionally well in web-based
mapping applications and excels at interoperability, visualization, and
data exchange via APIs.

If you’re looking to deepen your knowledge, consider reading [RFC 7946](https://geojson.org/),
which defines the GeoJSON standard. You can also explore how to run
spatial queries on GeoJSON data using PostGIS, or try out rendering
GeoJSON in client-side libraries like Leaflet.js, OpenLayers, or Mapbox.
