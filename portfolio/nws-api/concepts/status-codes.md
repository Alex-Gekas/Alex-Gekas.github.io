# HTTP Status Codes in the NWS API

The NWS API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. This page provides an overview of possible responses and how to interpret them.

Each API endpoint also lists the most common status codes returned in its context.  
See the [Endpoints section](../endpoints/index.md) for details.

## Error Response Format

When an error occurs, the API returns a structured JSON response like this:

```json
{
  "title": "Bad Request",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "The value provided for 'area' is not valid.",
  "type": "https://api.weather.gov/problems/InvalidParameter"
}
```
