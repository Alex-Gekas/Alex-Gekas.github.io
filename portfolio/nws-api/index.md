# NWS API Reference

This API reference introduces the key concepts and most commonly used endpoints of the U.S. National Weather Service API. It's designed for developers who are new to geospatial and weather data, not for internal NWS developers.

Rather than listing every endpoint, this guide focuses on:

- Explaining the NWS data model (gridpoints, forecast zones, alerts)

- Clarifying common stumbling blocks (e.g., how to go from coordinates to forecasts)

- Providing real-world examples with annotated responses
