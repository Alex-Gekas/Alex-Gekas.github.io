## Notes

- This endpoint returns results in [GeoJSON](../concepts/geojson.md) format.
- Polygons represent the actual affected area, not just a bounding box or forecast grid.
- Use filters such as `area`, `event`, or `severity` to narrow results and improve performance.
- Alerts may overlap or supersede one another.
- For more on how alerts differ from forecast data, see [Alerts vs Forecasts](../concepts/alerts-vs-forecast.md).
