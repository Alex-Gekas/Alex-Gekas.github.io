## Notes

- The `/points` endpoint translates geographic coordinates into an NWS gridpoint, which is used for retrieving forecast and observation data.
- The response includes links to:
  - A 7-day forecast (`forecast`)
  - An hourly forecast (`forecastHourly`)
  - Grid-level data (`forecastGridData`)
  - Observation stations (`observationStations`)
- This endpoint is often the first step when building a weather application based on location.
- For more about how the gridpoint system works, see [Gridpoints Explained](../concepts/gridpoints.md).
