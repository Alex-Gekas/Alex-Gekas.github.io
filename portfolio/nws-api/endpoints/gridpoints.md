## Notes

- Gridpoints are assigned to local NWS Forecast Offices (WFOs). You must include the correct `office` code.
- The `gridX` and `gridY` values define a cell in the WFO's forecast grid.
- You can get these values by calling the [`/points/{lat},{lon}`](./forecast.md) endpoint first.
- The forecast response includes time-segmented periods (day, night, etc.), each with:
  - Temperature
  - Wind speed
  - Forecast description
- The endpoint path may be extended to include `/forecast/hourly` for more granular data.
- For more details on the grid system, see [Gridpoints Explained](../concepts/gridpoints.md).
