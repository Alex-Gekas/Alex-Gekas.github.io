## Notes

- Use this endpoint to browse or filter all NWS stations.
- Each station includes metadata such as location, elevation, and station ID.
- You can access a specific station directly with:
  - `/stations/{stationIdentifier}`
- For stations near a forecast point, use the `/gridpoints/{office}/{gridX},{gridY}/stations` endpoint.
- Station IDs (for example, `KBUF`) are commonly used in observations and reports.
