## Notes

- Zones are used to group locations for issuing alerts and forecasts.
- Each zone has a unique ID like `CAZ041` (public), `CAZ293` (fire), or `PZZ130` (marine).
- The `zone` query parameter can be used with the `/alerts` endpoint to find active warnings for that area.
- This endpoint doesn't return polygon geometry. For geographic shapes, see the alert response’s GeoJSON.
- For a conceptual explanation, see [Zones Explained](../concepts/zones.md).
