# Code Examples

This section contains example code for interacting with the National Weather Service API using different tools and programming languages. These examples are designed to help developers quickly test endpoints and understand how to access key features such as forecasts, alerts, and observations.

---

## Available Examples

### cURL
Use the command-line tool `curl` to send simple GET requests to the API. Great for quick testing and debugging.

### JavaScript
Examples using `fetch` to retrieve data in the browser or with Node.js.

### Python
Use the `requests` library to access the API and parse JSON responses in backend scripts or notebooks.

## Notes

All examples include a `User-Agent` header, which is required by the NWS API. Replace `your-email@example.com` with your actual contact email or project URL.
